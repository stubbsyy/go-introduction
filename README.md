# go-introduction

As of March 1st, 2022 there is nothing here yet but a skeleton repo. I will be updating as I begin to learn and post my videos to YouTube. 

This is the start of my Go learning experience. I will try to document as much as I can during this process. 

I am new to Go and figured if I can learn and then eventually teach it then I might be off to a good start.
